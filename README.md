# AUT-CNN-TUB
Deep-learning object identification for robot-based assembly

## Data Excess
Data Excess will be granted via AWS S3, therefore  you need an VPN connection.

## Pre-Processing
During the Pre-Processing all the images get centred and well shaped with a predefined scale.
Therefor we use OpenCV.

## Work with limited Data:
We use Augmentor with some custom operations to augment our data set.
